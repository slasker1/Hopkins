We will briefly study the underlying principles of diverse machine learning approaches such as anomaly detection, ensemble learning, deep learning with a neural network, etc. The main focus will be applying tool libraries from the Python-based Anaconda and Java-based Weka data science platforms to datasets from online resources such as Kaggle, UCI KDD, open source repositories, etc. We will also use Jupyter notebooks to present and demonstrate several machine learning pipelines.
